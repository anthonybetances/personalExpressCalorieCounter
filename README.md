## Summary

This web app is the beginning of what will become a calorie tracker.  As of right now, users and input foods and their corresponding calorie amounts, and delete entries as they see fit.  Once I work out the sum of the calories, I'll be adding inputs for macros (proteins, carbs, and fats) so that users can accurately plan their meals and compare their planned intake to their daily calorie/macro goals or limits.
